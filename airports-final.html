                <h2>1. Princess Juliana International Airport (TNCM) - St. Maarten</h2>
                <p>Famous for its breathtaking low approach over Maho Beach, this Caribbean gem tops our list. The short runway and mountainous terrain make it a thrilling challenge for pilots of all skill levels. The crystal-clear waters and stunning beach scenery create an unforgettable visual experience.</p>

                <h2>2. Kai Tak Airport (VHHX) - Hong Kong (Historical)</h2>
                <p>Though closed in 1998, this legendary airport lives on in flight simulators. The infamous "checkerboard" approach required pilots to make a dramatic 47-degree turn at low altitude between skyscrapers. It remains one of the most demanding approaches ever designed.</p>

                <h2>3. Innsbruck Airport (LOWI) - Austria</h2>
                <p>Nestled in the heart of the Alps, Innsbruck presents pilots with a challenging one-way-in, one-way-out operation surrounded by towering peaks. The scenic mountain views are spectacular, especially during winter when snow blankets the landscape.</p>

                <h2>4. London Heathrow (EGLL) - United Kingdom</h2>
                <p>As one of the world's busiest airports, Heathrow offers complex operations, multiple runways, and intricate taxiway systems. It's perfect for those who want to experience high-density traffic management and precision flying in a major international hub.</p>

                <h2>5. Dubai International (OMDB) - United Arab Emirates</h2>
                <p>This ultra-modern airport showcases impressive architecture and serves as a gateway between East and West. The desert setting provides unique visual challenges, and the sheer scale of operations makes it ideal for long-haul simulation.</p>

                <h2>6. Lukla Airport (VNLK) - Nepal</h2>
                <p>Considered one of the world's most dangerous airports, Lukla sits at 9,334 feet elevation with a short, sloped runway that ends at a mountain wall. This gateway to Mount Everest tests even the most experienced pilots with its extreme terrain and unpredictable weather.</p>

                <h2>7. San Francisco International (KSFO) - United States</h2>

                <p>Surrounded by the Remarkables mountain range and situated on Lake Wakatipu, Queenstown combines natural beauty with technical flying challenges. Variable winds and mountainous terrain require careful planning and execution.</p>

                <h2>9. Gibraltar International (LXGB) - Gibraltar</h2>
                <p>This unique airport features a runway that intersects with a busy road, requiring traffic to stop for aircraft. Strong crosswinds from the Mediterranean and the imposing Rock of Gibraltar make every landing an adventure.</p>
